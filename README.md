# Alcohol-Consumption-AI-Assistant

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

The goal of this project is to create an AI-powered app that measures a user's percieved sobriety and blood alcohol levels, providing a safe and somewhat reliable solution to alcohol consumption using AI methods and real-time calculations for the individual using alot of learning and testing data + user data.


## Background

Alcohol has been a part of human society for thousands of years. It is believed that brewing and consuming alcohol were some of the earliest activities in agricultural societies around the world. Today, alcohol is the most widely used substance in the world, and it shows no signs of slowing down. In fact, the global market for alcoholic beverages is growing rapidly, with an estimated worth of 1.6 trillion dollars in 2020 for example. Alcohol has become a part of many cultures and is deeply ingrained in a lot of people´s social lives. 
There are many methods to make alcohol consumption safer and there are also many applications and calculators, but none of them is sophisticated enough and is, at most a some form of regression. Goal of this project would be to combat and conquer these problems:

* Driving under influence - The assistant would provide information about the user´s calculated state of alcohol influence and would actively discourage the user from using a vehicle, until his alcohol levels are sufficiently low.
* Self-inflicted harm under influence - The assistant would also discourage the user from other dangerous activities while under the influence, trying to reduce the risks and harm.
* Alcohol poisoning - The assistant would send warning notifications to user, when nearing their calculated alcohol limitations. The problem is, that quick consumption can lead to confusing in self-percieved sobriety or drunkeness in individuals.
* Innacurate results of calculators - The applications and calculators widely available operate on low amount or variables. With the AI-powered assistant in mind, the users would have more accurate results from machine learning methods and their own past data and the assistant would also take into consideration their own built tolerance and other conditions.
* Use of medication / health conditions - The application calculations would also encompass the use of medication or recreational substances with alcohol and the health conditions of users for the purpose of harm reduction.
* Too many variables - There are too many variables when dealing with sobriety and alcohol levels. It is not just the amount of alcohol. In the AI assistant, users would be able to provide more variables, not just their age, gender and weight. Some of these factors could include amount of sleep, types of food eaten through the day, different brands and types of alcohol, different types of measuring units and volumes. 
* Differing regulations around the globe - The assistant would provide users with information about local laws about alcohol consumption. For example, in some countries, some alcohol levels behind the wheel are acceptable, in some countries the drinking age regulations differ, and in some cities, there is a some kind of local prohibiton. The assistant would provide this information and summarize it in the application. This would be useful for users while travelling or on a vacation.


## How is it used?

The AI solution would be a mobile or smart-watch application. The smart watch application solution could provide more data to the users and also collect more -> nowadays smart watches are capable of measuring the user´s sleep, pulse and other bodily functions. The solution would be useful in day to day informal settings when socializing and consuming alcoholical beverages -> restaurants, pubs, parties, festivals.

1. The users would provide the assistant with the required data about themselves when setting up the environment.
2. The users would provide the assistant data before going to the attended setting, where they assume the alcohol consumption.
3. The users would inform the assistant on how much they drank and of what types of beverages through the evening.
4. The assistant would guide the users on their alcohol levels and percieved level of influence / sobriety through the evening.
5. After the setting is over, or in the next morning, the assistant would summarize the setting for the user and provide charts
and useful information -> At which time are they going to be completely sober, what to do to sober up faster, or if they need more rest.

-> The assistant would give notifications to users and remind them to hydrate themselves with plain water, and provide other harm-reduction methods.
-> The assistant would take into account the user´s drinking habits and would recommend the user to abstain from consumption when certain criteria is met
or recommend the user to a local clinic or a clinician when dealing with an addiction.

The users are individuals, who consume alcoholic beverages on daily, weekly, monthly basis or even once a lifetime. Their age should be legal drinking age and upwards.
Even though, the younger generations are more interested in AI solutions.

## Data sources and AI methods

Data sources:
1. User input: This could include data such as age, gender, weight, alcohol type, amount consumed, time frame, etc.
2. User’s smart watch: This could include data such as heart rate, temperature, activity level, sleep patterns, etc.
3. External sources: This could include data from local laws, regulations, and restrictions regarding alcohol consumption, as well as health data from clinics and hospitals.
4. Clinical Trials: Experimental users would be tested by accurate alcohol testers to gather data. This data could be used to further refine the AI algorithms and ensure that the AI assistant is providing accurate predictions and recommendations.
5. Storing data in a database: This would allow the AI assistant to store the user’s data input and the external data in an organized manner, allowing for easy access and retrieval.

AI methods:
1. Regression analysis: This could be used to predict the user’s level of influence or sobriety based on the user’s data input and the external data.
2. Natural Language Processing (NLP): This could be used to provide the user with personalized recommendations based on their data input and the external data.
3. Reinforcement learning: This could be used to suggest the best action to take in order to stay within safe limits of alcohol consumption and reduce harm.
4. Machine Learning: This could be used to infer patterns from the user’s data input and the external data, allowing the AI assistant to better predict the user’s level of influence or sobriety.
5. Neural Networks: This could be used to identify correlations between the user’s data input and the external data, allowing the AI assistant to better understand the user’s behavior and make more accurate predictions.
6. Clustering: This could be used to group together users with similar data input and external data, allowing the AI assistant to provide more personalization.

## Challenges

The greatest challenge and limitation is the collection of data and training the algorithms to correctly calculate the results. 
There should be option for users to not share their personal information, with the condition, that the accuracy of the application would be lowered.

This solution does not solve the problem of alcoholism and ignorance. The user can still act against the assistant´s wishes and consume more or ignore the application altogether. The solution works only if the user decides to cooperate. Also, when the individual is too much under the influence, they might loose the abilitiy to navigate the environment.

The application should not become a go-to for underage alcohol consumption and should not become the advertiser for specific establishments, types of alcohol or clinicians.

## What next?

1. Somebody would need to write a code for prototype application and lay some kind of programmed fundation. For this, a great skillset or a team of developers and funds would be required to start the development.

2 Gathering more data: To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the AI assistant, more data would need to be gathered from both users and external sources. This could be done through surveys and clinical trials.

3 Refining the algorithms: As more data is gathered, the algorithms used by the AI assistant need to be refined and improved in order to provide more accurate results.

4. Developing additional features: The AI assistant could be developed further by adding additional features that would be beneficial to the user. For example, the assistant could provide information about local laws and regulations regarding alcohol consumption, or provide personalized recommendations based on the user’s data input and external data.

5.Connecting the application with other services: Another way to improve the AI assistant is to connect it with other services, such as a taxi-hailing app or a health monitoring service. This would allow the AI assistant to provide more comprehensive assistance to the user.

6.Expanding the user base: The more users that use the AI assistant, the more data can be gathered and the more accurate the results will be. Therefore, it is important to expand the user base by incorporating more users and making sure that the AI assistant is easily accessible.

7. Integrating with existing services: Another way to improve the AI assistant is to integrate it with existing services and platforms. For example, integrating it with social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter, or with online mapping services such as Google Maps, could allow the AI assistant to provide more comprehensive assistance to the user.

8. Improving the user interface: The user interface of the AI assistant should be designed in such a way that it is easy to use and understand. This would allow the user to quickly access the information and features provided by the AI assistant.
